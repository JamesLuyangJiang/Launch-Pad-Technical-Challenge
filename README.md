# Launch-Pad-Technical-Challenge

Q: All your friends have been asking you, what is Machine Learning? Some people think it is the solution to world hunger, while others think it is just a stupid fad. You want to show your friends that machine learning is powerful for certain circumstances, using examples that they can easily understand. Explain techniques and challenges with ML with respect to your example, and convince us that Machine Learning is not just a buzzword.

To me, Machine Learning(ML) is a set of algorithms that helps machines like computers to learn knowledge from examples and be able to apply them to new and similar cases. 

One really amazing example would be the text recognition feature on iphones' camera last years. When you face your camera to a section of text on books, slides, or posters, you will see the button that takes "shots" of text section and allows you to select any texts from that section. You can easily copy it to somewhere else. If you face it on a section of handwritten text, it can still recognize correctly most of the time! For many people it is really an amazing function, and I believe it is achieved with intensive application of ML. Imagine this senario: you are attending a webinar with lots slides throughout the presentation, you want to copy some notes down from some slides, but if you copy them with your hand, it will take too much time and you might miss subsequent sections. So here it is! You can simply face your camera to that slide, and easily copy the texts onto your notes! Even if the presenter is showing some hand-written paragraphs, you can still recognize them with ML!

There are lots of challenges for sure in this application. For example, even in computers, there are many different fonts, and some of them are really hard to recognize, not to mention that everyone has different style of handwriting. To improve the accruracy of recognition, we need to collect extensive amount of tranning data to try to cover as much font types as we can. We will set up a neural network just like a human brain, which will look through the tranning data set and get some information from them, such as some parameters, or some features and their weights. The tranning data set also contains labels for each data, such as the correct letter. For this example, we can take the pictures as lots of pixels, and try to see which parttern of layout corresponds to the letter "a", and also consider variantions by calculating some tolerance differences.
