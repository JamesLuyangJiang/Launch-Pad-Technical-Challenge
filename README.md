# Launch-Pad-Technical-Challenge

All your friends have been asking you, what is Machine Learning? Some people think it is the solution to world hunger, while others think it is just a stupid fad. You want to show your friends that machine learning is powerful for certain circumstances, using examples that they can easily understand. Explain techniques and challenges with ML with respect to your example, and convince us that Machine Learning is not just a buzzword.
